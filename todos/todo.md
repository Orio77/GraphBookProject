## Text Fragments

1. Write a method to divide the fragments further, into smaller parts than a whole page. 
- Create an interface with divide() method
- first method would halve the page, that would be improved with NLP later on

## Database Edges

1. Write method to create edges between every pair of given texts


## Similarity Calculation

1. Write Java code for sending HTTP requests

2. Write Python code for interacting with an llm

3. Write python code for receiving the text's from HTTP request and returning the similarity score

4. Write Java code for retrieving the double score result

Q: What are some other NLP tools for calculating the similarity that might be even more effective than small llm's like BERT?

## Querying the Database
- Search Engine, creating a 'Tag', removing it
...


## Improvements

1. Q: Can I train a model by giving it examples of texts, where it's job would be to parse the biggest possible part of the text that is of same context? It would receive a text with mid sentence beginnings and ends, say, a page of a book. It would have to retrieve the biggest part of the text that 'makes sense' and the retrieved part does not start nor end mid sentence. Would it be hard to accomplish? How to use that model later on?

2. Create a Javascript-React Graph view

3. Selecting the .pdf from file explorer

4. Handling the .txt files

...



## Questions

**goal - use GPT's browser version for repeated requests**
Q: The google search has a window for the user to type something. When hit enter, it shows search results. Can I access that search window 
and parse the text that shows? Is it doable at a code level without an API? 


## Remember

!! Use Interfaces for objects mangement for them to be interchangable components
